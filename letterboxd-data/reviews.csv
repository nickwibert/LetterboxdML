<i>
</i>A truly unique and beautiful film that justifies out-of-order storytelling in the form of a reverse love story.  A great cast does an amazing job of making the convoluted plot consumable for the viewer.  I found myself so engaged in the quirky characters and plot that it was near impossible to find anything about the film I did not like.  Combine a very emotional romance drama with touches of science fiction, comedy, and overall weirdness, and you'll have the gem that is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",,2016-06-10
2016-06-12,Pleasantville,1998,https://boxd.it/a48Nt,4,,"<i>""Honey, I'm home!""</i>

Very original and thought-provoking, Pleasantville provides an interesting concept coupled with great visuals using the parallel of greyscale vs color (a shot that comes to mind is a car driving through a forest where everything is black and white except the tons of pink rose petals falling to the ground).  While it did seem to drag on in the second half, the movie still succeeded in creating some social commentary in a very unique way.  It may have served better as a short film rather than a full-length feature film, but Pleasantville is an entertaining and intelligent movie that is well worth watching.",,2016-06-11
2016-06-14,Nightcrawler,2014,https://boxd.it/a5JDH,4,,"<i>""Why you pursue something is as important as what you pursue.""</i>

This movie deviates from most in that it forces you to dislike the protagonist based on his actions and immorality.  The story is very interesting and you are kept on the edge of the seat through many intense action sequences.  Though the protagonist is very selfish and practically everything he does is for his own gain, I still found myself rooting for him most of the time.  By the end of the film my opinion of the main character had changed from one of sympathy and support to one of complete hatred.  All in all a riveting and unique film that is definitely one of the top movies of its year.",,2016-06-13
2016-06-15,Into the Wild,2007,https://boxd.it/a6m71,4.5,,"<i>HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED</i>
<i>
</i>Absolutely beautiful.  This film is impossibly beautiful, inspiring, and depressing all at the same time.  The poignancy of the movie is only increased when it is taken into consideration that the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless is real.  A man seeking a purpose changes the lives of people he meets along his journey.  The acting is impeccably admirable and very real, causing the viewer to very easily become attached to the many average yet loveable characters.  Emile Hirsch <i>is</i> Christopher McCandless, with such a convincing and heartwrenching performance it made me believe he actually lived this story.  This is a prime example of how a biographical film should be, chronicling the journey of an admirably determined young man while inspiring and teaching the viewers to appreciate life, nature, and happiness.",,2016-06-14
2016-06-18,Finding Dory,2016,https://boxd.it/a80iZ,2.5,,"<i>""Just keep swimming.""</i>

Not surprisingly, this was a good movie.  It was definitely better than what I expected after seeing the trailers.  It meets the Pixar standard for quality animation, good story, and plenty of emotional moments.  This is Dory's story, as evidenced by the title, and it works very well.  Her story is tied into the beginning of Finding Nemo so that we see how she came across Marlin, and then the plot begins a year after the events of the prior film.  It's nice to see old characters return and the new characters fit well in this world.  While the movie does feel repetitive at times, having a similar plot to the first movie, and sometimes even a bit frantic, the story ties up nicely and provides plenty of laughs while teaching valuable lessons about loss, family, and believing in yourself.",,2016-06-17

Another great film from Tarantino.  If you're a sucker for historical accuracy then this movie is definitely not for you.  It depicts a fictional ending to WWII that I think we all would love to have happened.  Great performances from great actors, a lot of suspense, great action, more than a few twists, and Tarantino's infamous disturbing imagery sprinkled with some dark humor mak<i>e</i> for an entertaining fictional war film.",,2016-06-20

2016-06-27,The Fundamentals of Caring,2016,https://boxd.it/aeQ9n,3.5,,"<i>""Trevor Conklin was handsome and cool.""</i>
<i>
</i>A great comedy drama about an eighteen-year old named Trevor who suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and his caregiver, who decides to take Trevor on a road trip so that he can get out and see the world in person rather than on TV.  The movie makes light of Trevor's disability, entirely because of Trevor's extremely dry and cynical view of himself and the world, which caused me to laugh more than a few times.  Selena Gomez seems randomly thrown in if you simply read over the cast and plot, but she really shines in her role as a young rebellious woman who feels the need to get to Denver for whatever reason.  A pregnant woman named Peaches joins along to complete the four person road trip.  What started as an outing for Trevor to see some dumb attractions in the US ends up as a journey in acceptance and moving forward, as the internal conflicts of each of these characters are resolved by the end.    The pregnant woman doesn't really fit or add much to the story, but overall it doesn't do any real harm to the film itself.

A quirky movie with acting that isn't revolutionary but is good, a simple plot that works, and some touches of heartfelt emotion as well as dark comedy make this an overall worthwhile film to add to your watchlist (if you're a Netflix subscriber, of course).",,2016-06-26

<i>""Well, I haven't killed you yet.""</i>

In short, Lethal Weapon exemplifies practically everything that an action movie should strive to be.  The film abounds with great action sequences and funny quips from really loveable characters.  It's cheesy at times, but what can you really expect from an '80s action flick?  Plus, who <i>wouldn't</i> want to see Mel Gibson facing Gary Busey in muddy hand-to-hand combat?",,2016-07-02
2016-07-04,The Muppets,2011,https://boxd.it/ak6wx,4,Yes,"<i>""Am I a man or am I a Muppet?""</i>

If you don't like the Muppets then you are simply a heartless individual.  This movie was a fantastic reintroduction into main culture for the Muppets.  It succeeds at being a feel-good family movie that is still enjoyable for all ages with plenty of laughs and some superb music (which, in my opinion, is what truly makes this movie).  Jason Segel and Amy Adams fit well in their supporting roles and the plot is very clever.  Overall this is a great family comedy that fits right in with the classic Muppet films of the late 20th century.",,2016-07-03
2016-07-05,Cast Away,2000,https://boxd.it/albgB,4,Yes,"<i>""The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself.""</i>
<i>
</i>Nothing like an epic island survival film.  Tom Hanks really shines in this role of a survivor who uses wits to survive while at the same time slowly losing his sanity, beginning with the creation of his volleyball friend Wilson.  You know this film did it right when you actually feel sympathy for Chuck over the loss of Wilson, nothing more than an inanimate object.  Most of the movie doesn't seem to have much of a meaning as it simply depicts a man struggling for survival; however, when Chuck makes it back and sees how easy living is compared to his prior situation and how everyone takes it for granted, there's an obvious message about the gluttony and ungratefulness that exists in today's society.  This really is a classic film and its popularity is made obvious when pretty much everyone understands the ""WILSON!"" reference.  This would be on my list of movies that everyone should watch at some point in their life.",,2016-07-04
2016-07-08,Swiss Army Man,2016,https://boxd.it/anEP5,4,,"<i>""Manny, if you don't know Jurassic Park, you don't know shit.""</i>

I want to write a lengthy review about why I really enjoyed this movie but I honestly have no idea how to explain it, so this probably will be me babbling on.  It definitely strikes me as a movie that you either really like or really hate.  The first fifteen minutes had me wondering why I spent money to watch this stupid movie, but by the end I had come to peace with the film's weirdness and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Weird is definitely the first word that comes to mind -- REALLY freaking weird, but at the same time beautiful in a way.  The strange small talk that Hank (living dude) has with Manny (dead dude) truly embodies what it means to be human.  Most of the movie doesn't deal with survival as you might think, but rather Hank teaching Manny about concepts of life, which range from true love and fear to masturbation.  Yeah, this movie will gross you out at some point.

I'm not sure what genre this movie fits under, because even the movie itself seems confused as to what type of film it is.  The elements that stand out the most to me make me categorize this as a dark survival buddy comedy, with weird elements of love and philosophy about life (one of my favorite parts, Manny in tears asks <i>""What is this? What is life?""</i>).  There is a great underlying message about self-acceptance, and also how everyone is at least a little weird.  I found myself laughing, cringing in gross horror, and on the verge of tears all throughout this movie.  I have a feeling the people behind this movie intended to put you in a very confused emotional and mental state throughout the runtime of the film as you struggle to understand what's going on.  Oh and a little side note, I absolutely love that the score of the movie is literally just acapella from the two leads, singing ""la, la, la"" and such, it's so strange and beautiful.

I feel like this review sounds negative but I don't know how else to word it.  I definitely enjoyed the movie, I think that everyone should give it a try, but I certainly don't think it's a movie for everyone.  The constant fart jokes at the beginning may make you believe you're about to sit through the dumbest movie ever made, but trust me, you really have no idea what you will get yourself into when you watch this.  Weird yet beautiful is all I can say.",,2016-07-07
2016-07-15,Ghostbusters,2016,https://boxd.it/atruP,3,,"<i>""Ah, HELL naw, the devil is a LIAR!!""</i>

I had terribly low expectations for this movie because I found the trailers incredibly dumb and cringeworthy.  I expected a CGI mess of callbacks to a classic film which would essentially ruin my childhood.  I believe that it's because of the low expectations that I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, which turned out to be not too bad.  There were some very funny moments and I'm not going to lie there were quite a few moments where I was putting my face in my hands in shame of what Hollywood has become.  Overall, it kept me entertained, which really seemed like the only goal the filmmakers had here.  Good comedy performances and some surprisingly cool action as well as a clever final villain (which, thank God, wasn't simply a reused Stay Puft Marshallow Man).

Did we need this movie to be made?  Heck no.  Is it entertaining and worth a watch, even if you just rent it? Sure.  Can't complain about a movie that overall is a lot of fun.",,2016-07-14

This is an iconic film that set benchmarks for all the buddy cop, action comedy, and Eddie Murphy movies to come.  This fairly simple plot works due to hilarious moments thanks to Murphy's performance, some pretty great action, and an amazing soundtrack that won all kinds of awards.  If you haven't seen this movie and have heard the Crazy Frog song, yeah, they took that from this movie's theme.  Catchy stuff that fits right in with the action you see unfolding onscreen.",,2016-07-15

I've neither read Jungle Book nor seen the Disney cartoon.  I know, I have no childhood, but either way I wanted to see this movie because of the praise it was receiving.  I thought it was very entertaining and was a nice middle ground between the extremely serious, dark book and the lighthearted Disney cartoon (from what I've heard).  The CGI is absolutely stunning, and is definitely my favorite aspect of the movie and in my opinion is what made it so great.  All the animals look so lifelike and the child actor playing Mowgli does an amazing job of convincingly interacting with the digital creatures.  The celebrity voice actors may seem random and only included for publicity but they fit the characters appropriately.

Christopher Walken singing as King Louie is hilarious and I love it.",,2016-07-16
2016-07-20,Hush,2016,https://boxd.it/axfaV,3.5,,"<i>""When you wish you're dead... that's when I'll come inside.""</i>

I like how this movie emerged from the horror tropes that you tend to see every second in scary films.  A deaf and mute protagonist trapped in her house and being antagonized by a serial killer is a very unique concept that the movie executes fairly well.  There's a good suspense factor throughout most of the movie, and the acting wasn't all that great but it wasn't atrocious, it still worked for the film.  It starts off kinda slow but builds up to a nice suspenseful finale, which I think was done well except for a couple minor things that were a little cheesy and unreasonable.

Overall this is a suspenseful horror film that has a similar feel to classics like <i>Friday the 13th</i> and <i>Scream</i> while still setting itself apart with an original spin on the genre.  There is a fair amount of gore as would be expected from a serial killer flick, so be warned that this isn't for those with a weak stomach.  Worth the watch so long as you enjoy it for what it is and try not to nitpick.",,2016-07-19
2016-07-21,Galaxy Quest,1999,https://boxd.it/axYn1,3.5,,"<i>""By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Worvan, you shall be avenged.""</i>

<i>Galaxy Quest</i> is a funny parody of Star Trek, and the concept is unique.  The actors of a Star Trek-esque television show are asked for help by a real alien species that falsely believes they are indeed the real space commanders they play.  There are lots of jokes that poke fun at the science fiction fan base as well as science fiction in general (as aforementioned, specifically Star Trek).  The acting isn't terrific but it works for the movie and I found it overall quite funny.  There are some great practical special effects when it comes to the enemy aliens as well.

Overall this is a funny and entertaining parody of science fiction shows/films.  But, it's just that and nothing more; a fun film that does not strive to be anything more than a unique parody, which isn't a bad thing, but rather is my reasoning for my average rating.  Worth the watch but only if you at least slightly enjoy science fiction.",,2016-07-20
2016-07-25,The Running Man,1987,https://boxd.it/aB4Pr,3,,"<i>""Hello, cutie pie.  One of us is in deep trouble.""</i>

<i>The Running Man</i> is based off a book of the same name, which the unique concept can be attributed to.  The film is entertaining with pretty good action and mediocre acting, and plenty of cheesy 80's action flick goodness.  Expect plenty of Schwarzenegger's cringeworthy one-liners that he is famous for (after choking a man to death, he nonchalantly states ""what a pain in the neck"").  The film plays off of Arnold's post-Terminator popularity WAY too much, even recycling one of the most famous lines from that movie, ""I'll be back.""

As a self proclaimed Arnold addict and a lover of 80's action films, I think this was a good movie.  On a side note I'm starting to wonder if the author of Hunger Games took inspiration from this novel/film as there are more than a few similarities in the concept.",,2016-07-24

<i>""Remembering everything doesn't mean you know everything.""</i>

This movie is good as an action flick but it doesn't quite live up to the standard set by its predecessors (excluding <i>Legacy</i>).  There's pretty good action, with car chases and random objects being used as weapons; everything you would expect from a <i>Bourne</i> film.  None of the action or acting itself was truly groundbreaking but it worked for what the film was trying to do.  There aren't any iconic moments or lines that you'll remember from the movie, but it's a satisfying and entertaining thrill ride of action nonetheless.",,2016-07-28

<i>""No.""</i>
<i>""Have you ever fired one gun whilst jumping through the air?""</i>
<i>""No.""</i><i>
</i>
<i>Hot Fuzz</i> really took me off guard and honestly blew me away.  Not that I had low expectations for this movie, not at all; rather, I was blown away by the crazy plot which twisted and turned and succeeded in being unpredictable while still very thrilling and gripping.  I went in expecting a buddy cop comedy with some British humor because, you know, Simon Pegg.  And while that definitely was in the movie, there were all kinds of genres thrown in there.  There are elements of horror/thriller, detective drama, and full on hardcore action flick (like Arnold Schwarzenegger levels!).  And I freaking loved it!  I didn't really know what was going to happen next, as the first half of the film seemed to be setting up a normal cop movie and then out of nowhere you get hit with a plot curveball that REALLY draws you in (at least it did in my case).  I also have a liking for dry and dark comedy, which this film is chock full of, ranging from Tarantino humor to Monty Python humor.  

Seriously, no wonder this film has very positive reception.  If you like action and dry humor then this is definitely the movie for you.  Even if you don't usually enjoy those genres, I think there is a good chance that you would like <i>Hot Fuzz</i> because of all the genres it could fit under.  Unpredictability is a powerful weapon in the hands of movie writers, and it's used very effectively here.",,2016-07-30

This is a great mystery crime film with an awesome and iconic twist revealed in the final moments.  While this movie is known for that twist, and while it was a mind blowing and well executed one, the rest of the film leading up to it was a bit confusing as it jumped back and forth between narration and flashbacks, and fairly boring at times as well.  Regardless, this is a classic film that used an awesome ending to rocket itself into fame, and it's worth the watch for pretty much anybody.",,2016-07-31

<b>NOTE:</b> As of the writing of this review, I have only been exposed to the contents of this film in the form of its trailer and the movie itself.  I have not read or seen anything else about the movie online, and as a result, the following is a collection of my original, unfiltered thoughts.

<b>• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • </b>
<b>
</b>If <b>Arrival</b> is not the best film of the year, it is at least one of the top 5.  What starts out as what seems to be your everyday science fiction story with alien life forms coming to Earth evolves into something much deeper and more philosophical.  While this movie certainly left questions in my mind, as every movie should, I still left feeling that I had a very strong understanding of the film's events and their meaning, and that's terrific. That means the makers of the film succeeded in getting their point across to their audience, at least in my case, while also leaving some things up in the air.

Films like these come along to remind us that the golden age of filmmaking isn't entirely gone; every once in a while, in an ocean of reboots/remakes, reused plots, and mindless children's or action films, a masterpiece comes along to blow you away.

Without delving into the deep concepts this movie deals with, some of which is too deep to fully comprehend, one can still appreciate the sci-fi plot devices used in such clever ways that make perfect sens<i>e</i> in the context of the film.  On more than one occasion, Louise (Amy Adams) ""recalls"" information from future memories; gaining an understanding of the heptopods' language has granted her the ability to essentially transcend time, retrieving vital information from events yet to occur that will ensure the peace and safety of the world in the present.

In addition to the extremely intelligent plot, this film boasts breathtaking visuals, an extremely intense and amazingly crafted soundtrack, and impressive acting from literally everyone on screen.

Perhaps reading online about some of my questions will give me some answers, because as previously stated, I haven't had any exposure past the film itself.  The question that is posed all throughout the film: ""What is your purpose on Earth?""  Was it every truly answered?  Yes, Costello (I love the names) does say that they offer this 'weapon' to humanity because ""HEPTOPODS NEED HELP FROM HUMANITY IN 3 THOUSAND YEARS"", or something along those lines, but this is hardly a satisfying answer.  This definitely isn't a gripe with the film, but rather an expression of curiosity.  What will happen in 3 thousand years?  Obviously the heptopods know, as they are on Earth now to ensure they will receive help in the future.

And about the whole traveling faster than the speed of light thing that Ian (Jeremy Renner) discovers?  I can only assume that it was a slight misinterpretation of the ability to transcend time, but I still am unsure of the whole 1/12 fraction thing and the 12 different vessels.  What was the significance?  Again, these are unfiltered thoughts that I could easily have missed in the film, and some research can clear up.

Overall, <b>Arrival</b> is most definitely 5 stars.  So thought provoking, and showcasing the negative sides to humanity with their refusal to work together and their instinct to immediately attack the heptopods.  The universal knowledge of the language seems to contribute to world peace through a collective understanding of one another in all humanity.  What a beautiful concept.",,2016-11-20
2016-12-28,Why Him?,2016,https://boxd.it/cLFTN,2,,"I hate movies that rely almost exclusively on crude sexual jokes (that aren't clever or funny in any way, but rather made for shock value) for the entirety of its runtime.  I kinda knew what I was getting into when I saw <b>Why Him?</b>, and it turned out just to be as terrible as I expected.  The only things that made me want to see this movie are Bryan Cranston and the fact that it was free for me to watch as a theater worker.  Coincidentally, Cranston's role is the only aspect keeping the film somewhat grounded in reality, and also the only thing that kept me from getting up and walking out at the 132nd pointless use of the word 'fuck'.


While I can't deny that I laughed a couple times and found certain parts amusing, I am never going to see this movie again and am very glad that I did not pay to see it.",,2016-12-27

The attempt at trying to make cool, unique editing with constant snappy cuts just ended up making the entire film extremely hard to follow, and random time jumps popped up every ten minutes with no rhyme or reason.

Terrible, cringeworthy jokes abound, which greatly pleased my advance screening audience.  My only laughter was invoked by the tons of unintentionally funny moments as well as just me reacting in complete awe at how much the audience was enjoying this crap. 

At one point they use shaky weird shots focused on the sides of the characters' heads as they ran, which just looked extremely amateur.  Like a teenager using a GoPro.  Furthermore, the 'epic' battles that the film ended with were chock full of seemingly incomplete CGI that was more rubbery than that infamous Matrix 2 scene.

The only reason I didn't give this a 1/2 star is because I didn't want it to be on the same level as <i>The Assignment</i>, and because I at least recognize the work and scope of the project, even if the execution was absolutely atrocious.  The score was pretty unique as well.","theatre, amc, advance screening",2017-04-27
2017-05-14,The Wall,2017,https://boxd.it/hcRHJ,3,,"<i>""I just want to get to know you.""</i>

I really enjoyed this film.  It's a very unique entry in the somewhat overdone military genre.  Rather than a guns blazing approach to this depiction of the Iraq war, the filmmakers opt for a character-driven psychological thriller that takes place in the same small area for the entire runtime.  While this sounds like it could easily bore the audience and drag on, something just made it work.  I'm not sure if it's the excellently set up shots, the convincing acting of Aaron Taylor Johnson, the mystery shrouding the Iraqi sniper, or the comically strange conversation between the lead and the sniper, but it just works.  The suspense builds really well throughout the movie and there are a few unexpected turns, even given the incredibly simple plot.  We learn about the characters through dialogue, which I absolutely love when executed correctly.  The portrayal of war is very realistic in this standoff, and the lack of a score just adds to the immersion and suspense.  While it may seem to drag a bit in scenes where Johnson fiddles with some equipment for a solid 5 minutes, its inclusion is justified and helps to put the viewer in the shoes of the character.  

While this certainly isn't one of the most amazing military movies I've seen, I have to give it major props for the originality and the boldness of the filmmakers for making this kind of movie.  If you like military movies or even just thrillers in general, then you will enjoy this movie.","theatre, cobb",2017-05-13
2017-05-26,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,2017,https://boxd.it/hsezD,2.5,,"<i>""Do we have an accord?""</i>

I don't think that this movie deserves the extreme hate it's been getting.  I also don't think it was amazing.  Certain aspects I loved, but there was also a lot that was underwhelming.  Sadly yet not unexpectedly, Jack Sparrow was probably the most underwhelming part of the entire film.  Other than being the reason behind the villain's actions, he doesn't really serve any other purpose.  He's just shoved in there because, you know, this is a Pirates movie so Jack has to be the main character.  The two young characters, Henry and Karina, really stood out and the movie was mostly about them in regard to the events unfolding.  Despite the writing pointing towards them leading, Jack Sparrow would still repeatedly poke his head out from behind them and slur some lifeless joke and stumble his way through horrifically fatal circumstances and somehow always make it out unscathed.  It is a bit amusing but it gets old, especially when you take a step back and question why he is even there.  It also seems that Johnny Depp has lost his understanding of the character; no longer do we have the witty and clever pirate who makes quick and smart decisions from the first film, but we now have a Jack who is an embodiment of only his drunkenness and bumbling foolishness without much of the wit to go along with it.  Everything else about this film was pretty good, the young characters had good arcs, but the CGI could get a little hard to watch sometimes.

Overall I'd say if you're a Pirates fan, give it a watch.  You'll have a good time.  This does not deserve such extreme hate but it also does not deserve praise.  I'm not sure how I feel about having another installment in this series; personally, I would have preferred ending with <i>At World's End</i> and having a nice trilogy, but money.  I'd put this a little below <i>At World's End</i> and far above <i>On Stranger Tides</i>.","theatre, cobb",2017-05-25

This is a sweet little gem of a short film.  Its simple yet emotional plot is representative of the earliest stages of filmmaking.  Film as we know it today is stripped down to its most basic feature, the imagery.  This forces the viewer to focus especially on what is in front of them without the distraction of the other elements which would be introduced into film as years went by (cinematography, score, etc.).  The version I watched featured a piano accompaniment composed in 2011 which matched through song the emotional content of the actions unfolding onscreen.  Assuming the 1912 audience would have had a live piano accompaniment that was similar, we can also attribute this classic as a prime example of what score contributes to the mood of a film and what emotions it evokes in the audience in collaboration with imagery.

Specifically in regard to the plot, this is a simple yet sweet tale dealing with sickness and the possibility of loss, as well as the inner workings of the mind of a child when dealing with serious concepts such as death.  So much is told simply through facial and bodily expression, an impressive feat for such an early film that we now see was extremely limited in storytelling compared to future films.  Regardless, it is one that should be cherished and reviewed for generations as an example of the universal and timeless expression of our humanity through the art of film.",,2017-05-30

<i>The General</i> is an amazing example of the physical comedy achieved purely through visuals in the days of silent film.  I went into this expecting to simply acknowledge what was considered humorous in the early 19th century society but not find it funny myself.  Instead, I found myself laugh out loud on more than one occasion while watching the insane antics of Buster's character.  A couple of my favorite moments include his leaping from table to table in order to be first in line for military recruitment and, of course, the iconic sequence involving him spread across the front of a train, frantically removing long blocks of wood obstructing the tracks placed by bandits who stole his original train.

I was all but blown away by a large number of the shots in this film.  The incredible scope of shots, such as the one depicting swarms of troops approaching over a distant hill while simultaneously showing soldiers lying on their stomachs in the foreground, are just so impressive when considering this film was released in the 1920s.  The money shots were also incredible; the explosions from cannons and the epic collapsing bridge and exploding train were undoubtedly expensive and just amazing to watch.  Even the basic plot of the film is very daunting for a 1920s film since the majority of the onscreen action takes place on moving trains, which must have been both difficult and expensive to shoot.

Taking all of these factors into account really gives this film a solid spot in cinematic history, one that still holds up relatively well today and remains incredibly impressive.","home, streaming",2017-05-31

Jesus H. Christ.  Why, DC? Just... why.

I have no idea where all this extremely positive reception is coming from.  This movie was bad.  Like, barely better than Suicide Squad bad.  People have been saying that this movie has broken the DC film losing streak, but I strongly disagree.

The pacing was extremely slow.  Much too slow.  The CGI was passable at best, but usually pretty awful, which is simply inexcusable, especially after the pretty good visual effects we've seen in BvS: Dawn of Justice.  Gal Gadot's acting was also passable.  She's a good Wonder Woman, but I could also name off at least five other actresses who could play the role as well as she does.  Chris Pine's character was probably the best part of the movie.  I think he played the role very well, and his character had some purpose as well as a nice arc.  So props for that.  But other than that small thing, there is very little about this movie that I really liked.  Just when I thought the movie was going to pick up during this (actually pretty great) scene where we FINALLY see Wonder Woman in action, about an hour into the movie, it just continued to flop afterward.

Don't even get me started on the villain.  I can't say too much without spoiling, but I can say that the final showdown was so laughably terrible that I was trying extremely hard to keep myself from exploding into laughter.  2005 video game graphics exploded from the third act, very reminiscent of the third act in King Arthur.  The villain's portrayal and line delivery tickled me ridiculously.  I got more enjoyment out of laughing at the end of this movie than the rest of the movie.

I put this at 2.5 stars for two reasons.  First of all, I have Suicide Squad at 2 stars, and this was better.  Second of all, there were a few things that I thought were truly great in this movie.  The scene in the middle where Wonder Woman finally decides to do something stands out as the indisputable best scene in this movie.  Some of the war scenes were alright, but definitely not the best.  At times this felt like a poorly made war drama with Wonder Woman just tacked on.  It probably wasn't a great idea to show a five minute preview of Dunkirk before this movie, because it just made me realize even more how bad this was as a war film.

Anyway, yeah.  2.5 stars.  DC has disappointed me again.  I will still see their upcoming movies and continue to cross my fingers that they can turn this thing around, because right now they are drowning.  Every new release is sinking them deeper and deeper.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-01

I watched this in class as the school year winds to an end.  I enjoyed it, it was quite an original concept, and I also love Tim Roth and Gary Oldman.  They played off of each other very well and there were a lot of very clever and funny moments.  It was quite interesting to watch the misadventures of these minor characters and how they intertwined with the story of <i>Hamlet.</i>  That being said, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more if I was more familiar with the story of <i>Hamlet</i>.  It was clear when certain pivotal events from that play were occurring as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern observed from ""off-stage.""  If you like Hamlet, this is definitely the movie for you.","other, dvd",2017-06-02
2017-06-03,Alien: Covenant,2017,https://boxd.it/hBLDL,3.5,,"<i>""Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.""</i>

This was a very good science fiction film.  It suffered from the same slow pacing in the first act as did the original <i>Alien</i>, but quickly picked up during the second act and culminated well in the final act.  I can say with complete certainty that you need to have seen <i>Prometheus</i> to fully enjoy this movie.  Which is to be expected, as Ridley Scott has already said many times that <i>Covenant</i> is a direct sequel.

Michael Fassbender steals the show once again with his great robot portrayal.  In fact, he is in center stage so often (which doesn't feel like it's overdone) that the Neomorphs and Xenomorphs almost feel less important. This most certainly is not a bad thing, and I think it works for the movie well.  I think I would have enjoyed the movie just as much without the Xenomorph, as its presence feels a lot like fan service (especially since Scott himself said in an interview that he only brought them back in this film because of audience backlash at <i>Prometheus</i>).  

Regardless, this is a great sci fi film with great acting from pretty much everyone involved, great visual effects, great cinematography, and a great story.  It continues and expands on the theme of creation/destruction established in <i>Prometheus</i>, and it does so in a great way.  Scott has essentially achieved a near perfect balance between the suspenseful, over-the-top gory Alien and the philosophical, mysterious Prometheus.  All <i>Alien</i> fans must see this movie and I have no doubt that they will enjoy it, as it contains the great ideas from <i>Prometheus</i> while also having an overall better execution.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-02

Rewatching this movie a couple of times recently has only strengthened my love for it and reaffirmed my belief that it is the best movie in the MCU.  Through doing this, however, the failings of the sequel are especially highlighted to me.  I will be rewatching the sequel in the coming week, and will elaborate on my thoughts in that review.

So, allow me to praise this film without going full fanboy (which is very difficult).  My inner fanboy thinks this is a five star film, and I love it enough to rate it as such, but I do my best to rate all films objectively by viewing it from a pure quality standpoint.  That being said, this is still a pretty freakin' good movie.  It stands out as the gem of the MCU, an extremely unique entry in the genre of epic space films that distances itself far away from the superhero films of the universe it resides in.  Seriously, it's extremely easy to forget that this is a Marvel movie just because of how starkly different it is.  And because it is so extreme, it could have been either really bad or really good.  Obviously, I think it is the latter.  I give huge props to Marvel for this bold move; not only is it a film centered on a very little known group of super weird heroes, but it also takes place in a completely different world than the previous films.  Despite these difficulties, they managed to create a lively and convincingly expansive universe filled with insane technology and interesting creatures.  The world is not so expansive that it is overwhelming; rather, the bits and pieces of the universe that we do see are indicative of a much larger picture.  The implicit expansiveness works really well for keeping the audience's attention amidst all the madness.

This is the funniest Marvel movie.  The writing is hilarious, with some specific moments standing out as absolute comedic genius.  The timing is perfect, and all of the humor flows very well.  That being said, the writing overall is very impressive, and all of the events of the story unfold at a nearly perfect pace, all the while being extremely funny.  It's a nice mixture of dry comedy, situational comedy, etc.  Chris Pratt is great as both a heroic figure and a funny awkward guy, Dave Bautista steals the show with his hilarious seriousness, and Bradley Cooper's foul mouthed insults as Rocket Raccoon are both childish and extremely witty.  So, huge props to the writers for that.  I'd say 90-95% of the jokes hit, even on a third or fourth viewing.

Next, the soundtrack.  Now I will admit I am a bit biased, as I have a certain affinity for music of the 70s-80s.  I love the majority of the songs in the soundtrack.  That is what I think the genius of the soundtrack is; the many pop songs included are loved by a massive number of people.  So, the filmmakers obviously knew their inclusion would appeal to many.  But rather than just shoving them in there randomly like many movies do, they wrote a logical reason for it into the story.  Star-Lord's entire drive is rooted in his mother, and all of the music included on the soundtrack was songs that she would show him from when she as a kid.  So props once again, for brilliantly weaving the pop soundtrack into the story and development of the main character.  I don't know why, but I feel like their music selection just fits the movie so well.  Maybe it's something about the stark contrast of the music with their environment, because they certainly don't match up.  But for whatever reason, it creates a very unique style and mood, one that only <i>Guardians</i> can have.

Now, colors.  The cinematography itself is alright in this movie; nothing too amazing, but it does its job well.  The colors of the various areas in the galaxies are what really stand out, especially in the MCU where color is usually somewhat washed and dull.  Every location they go to pops on the screen and is very pleasing to look at, even in intense action sequences.  Going along with this, the CGI in this movie is also great.  Space looks amazing, the ships look awesome, visual effects pop.  There are a few questionable effects, such as the fighting reptilian creatures that people were making bets on in a bar, which looked pretty bad in retrospect.  However, these are minor gripes in an otherwise great film.

This movie does suffer a lot of the same shortcomings as other movies in the MCU.  It has a somewhat predictable plot, a generic villain with generic goals, some of the jokes fall flat, and there are a few moments that are just plain cheesy.  Star-Lord is very unique but his personality can sometimes feel like a rehash of the Tony Stark playboy billionaire archetype, mostly in the cocky and witty cool guy sense.  But for the most part, these small things don't bother me much.  This film took some serious boldness, taking a leap from relatively grounded superhero movie into complete insanity.  But it managed to do so in an amazing way, creating a hilarious, emotional, and epic space adventure that also sets up the future of the MCU through the Infinity Stones and the presence of Thanos.  I love it.

Three years later, and Marvel still hasn't topped this.  In fact, I would say it has just gone downhill since this movie.  I have high hopes for Thor: Ragnarok, which seems to continue off of this idea of the colorful and psychedelic cosmos.  I can only say that I approach the future of the MCU with reluctance, especially after my relative disappointment with Civil War and Guardians 2.  Worst comes to worst, I can always come back and watch Guardians of the Galaxy again.","home, streaming",2017-06-04

<b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VERY MINOR SPOILERS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b>
<b>
</b><i>Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie</i> succeeds by being much more clever and consistently funny than the majority of kid's movies.  As with many others, I grew up reading (and loving) the book series on which this movie is based, written by Dav Pilkey.  When I first heard they were making a movie about Captain Underpants, I rolled my eyes in annoyance at another cash grab adaptation that would most likely ruin a beloved children's story.  When I saw the first trailer, my mentality became slightly more positive, but I still approached my viewing of this film with worry and reluctance.  I can now firmly say that this is a great and quite hilarious family movie that can be enjoyed by fans of the series and newcomers alike.

If you're a fan of the series, you will probably be as giddy as I was seeing all of the characters coming to life on the screen.  I immediarely recognized teachers with less than 5 seconds of screen time thanks to the loving recreation of Pilkey's art style, a transformation to CGI that still maintains the unique look of his cartoony creations.  Being a fan also lends to some problems that newcomers won't have.  In my case, I was slightly perturbed by the fact that villains from several different books were meshed into one, the origin story modified, and other small things such as those.  They don't really affect the quality of the movie in any way as the changes made usually were done with good reason and served a purpose to the plot or its characters.

As I already said, the animation did a great job of keeping the look of the books.  There is nothing groundbreaking, but I did find the animation pleasing to look at and enjoyed the rubbery fluidity of the characters' movements (akin to Tex Avery cartoons and the <i>Hotel Transylvania</i> movies).  I think that the voicework was pretty great across the board, which must have been tough considering every fan of the series has their own idea of what the characters should sound like.  Nick Kroll as Professor Poopypants and Ed Helms as Mr. Krupp/Captain Underpants stood out in particular, with Kroll nailing the exotic mad scientist voice and Helms doing a great job as both the terribly evil Mr. Krupp and goofy yet heroic Captain Underpants.  Kevin Hart voicing a child is a bit jarring at first but I got used to it quickly, and he did a good job.  Thomas Middleditch's mellow voice as Harold wasn't much of a stand out but he had some good moments, and it all served the characters well. 

Not only was the animation great, but the filmmakers also incorporated a variety of media for hilarious effect.  There was a live action sequence in the form of a sock puppet show (absolutely hysterical) and several sequences that were traditionally animated, which was a nice way to showcase the creativity and originality of George and Harold.  They used this to pay nice homage to the art style and events of the novels, which fans will undoubtedly love.

The writing is very witty and clever.  While there is an abundance of potty humor that I'm not really a fan of, one needs to remember that the entirety of this story rests on potty humor.  It's a bald man running around in his underpants.  I suppose I just don't enjoy it as much now as I did when I was younger, but rather than be annoyed by it I chose to appreciate the effort to remain faithful to the style of the books.  I don't know if Pilkey was very involved in this project, but it certainly seems as though he was, as the movie captures the feel of the books very well while still having various differences to make it feel original and new.  The movie also makes the gross out and other childish humor work really well because of how self aware it is, with many fourth wall breaks that make the jokes funnier than they should be.  In addition to all that, a lot of the gags and lines are <i>genuinely clever</i>, so clever that I can't help but laugh out loud.

I didn't rank this especially high because it's not some gem of a film and it doesn't reach for any kind of emotional messages other than the basic morals of ""all the bad guys want is to be loved"" and ""friendship is... important"" or something.  But that's not something this movie has to do either.  The books certainly didn't.  The over the top jokes about the school are both funny and also pack a painful truth to them, so there is some level of commentary on the education system, but other than that this is just a fun adventure rooted in the wild and creative imaginations of children (just like the books).  So it knows what it wants to be and does a great job of being it without trying too hard.

There were a few things that I didn't like about the movie too, which is why it's ranked 3.  I wasn't a fan of the (attempt at an) emotional arc with Krupp.  I can understand the reasoning behind it and it definitely serves one of the movie's themes, but it just ruins the character of Krupp as I know him.  He's always bad, and Captain Underpants is always the stark opposite of Krupp.  Two sides of the same coin.  So I'm wondering how they're going to deal with this in the inevitable sequel; I've thought of all the ways they could do it and none of them are really satisfactory.  The comedic timing in the movie was a little inconsistent, sometimes being slow and sometimes way too fast (carnival sequence).  

Overall, this is a very good kids movie that has humor for everyone, whether you're a fan of the series or not.  It doesn't overstay its welcome at a short runtime of 89 minutes, but it also feels like it did a good job of establishing the origin of Captain Underpants and setting up future movies.  The main thing that I really loved about this movie was that it understood that the Captain is <i>not</i> the main character of this story, but George and Harold are.  They are the center of the story, and their friendship is both convincing and endearing.  They really seem like lifelong friends that are perfect matches for one another, and they use their powerful friendship in a great way to resolve the conflict in the climax (which Captain Underpants was absent from long enough for me to start wondering when the heck he would come back, which was a good thing in the context of the scene).  See this movie if you like fun animated movies, and <i>especially</i> if you are a Captain Underpants fan.  The idea of a sequel puts worry in my mind, but I know that I will go out and see it regardless.<i>

<i>Coraline</i> is an amazing movie based on an even more amazing book by Neil Gaiman.  The story that gave me nightmares as a child yet intrigued me continues to creep me out today.  Major props to Gaiman for crafting such a brilliantly eerie story that almost has a Grimm's fairy tale feel to it.  As far as the movie goes, the adaptation is great and the stop-motion animation fits the mood of the story wonderfully.  There's something about stop-motion when used in horror that is just so incredibly unsettling but beautiful at the same time, as the visual effects are in this movie.  In addition, there is something about creepy kid's movies that is just so much more unsettling and scary than a straight up horror film.  Perhaps the stark contrast of the friendly characters and the horrifying monstrosities in the final act lend to this feeling, or just our preordained notion that a children's film should not contain imagery and ideas as dark as these.  Either way, this is an interesting and brilliant dark movie that is suitable for all ages, given you are prepared to be creeped out.  The mystery of this Other World is slowly unfolded at a perfect pace, and the various facets to the tale are all delightfully creepy.  This would definitely be in my top 5 favorite stop-motion films of all time, along with the likes of <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> and <i>Wallace and Gromit</i>.","home, streaming",2017-06-06

This was my second time seeing <i>Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2</i>, the first time being the premiere back in the beginning of May.  I gave it 3 stars then, and have now changed it to 3.5, and I'll explain why in this review.  I was disappointed at the premiere and didn't think it was very good, and while I still don't believe it lived up to the high bar set by its predecessor (or the high bar for a sequel set by <i>Winter Soldier</i>), it's still a pretty good superhero movie, better than the majority of the MCU films.  (I think part of the reason that my opinion has changed is because I was surrounded by hardcore DC fanboys at the premiere who probably hated on this movie more than it deserved.  Looking at you, Zac and Josh.)

The first <i>Guardians</i> film is, in my opinion, the best Marvel film and probably in the top 5 superhero films of all time (that might be a little bit of a stretch).  So I was naturally worried about the sequel, as sequels are notoriously worse.  As many others have already said, in this movie it feels like James Gunn took what people responded to positively in the first movie and went way overboard with it here.  The comedy has some great moments but often feels forced and just stupid, which never really happened in the first movie.  Don't even get me started on Baby Groot.  They're geniuses for incorporating him so much, because audiences love him, but I really can't stand the over the top cuteness.  It's obviously there to cater to all the people who say ""awww he's so cute"" while people like me are annoyed by their intentions.  He had some good moments, but for the most part it just felt like he shouldn't be around.  If they're shouting at him to get out of the way so he doesn't get hurt, why didn't they just leave him at a safe place to regenerate to full size?  Everything in the movie would have happened pretty much the same without Baby Groot (except one small thing in the climax).

A second viewing helped me to really appreciate the structure of this movie.  It's more character driven than the first, which was honestly a great idea.  Now that we have some familiarity with these characters, we can explore their demons.  Peter Quill and Drax were the only ones lacking here; Quill just felt dull throughout the movie and his arc was just a retread of the one from the first movie, and Drax is just Drax.  He reflects on his family some but doesn't have any significant change.  The conflict between the sisters and the bond forged between Yondu and Rocket stood out the most here.  They made Nebula's situation understandable and had Yondu and Rocket reflect on themselves by analyzing each other.

Speaking of Yondu, he was the stand out of this movie.  Many others agree, and with good reason.  He has the most satisfying, convincing, and significant arc out of everyone in the movie, the writing for his character is just fantastic, and Michael Rooker is just great.  Even though Michael Rooker is pretty much just playing himself (all his roles are basically Rooker with different hair or in this case, skin color), for some reason it works really well with the character.  It's a big change from the comic Yondu but it fits well with the style of these movies.

The group splits up and have separate journeys, a la Scooby-Doo.  Some people have criticized this but I enjoyed it to an extent.  Being separated for the majority of the film allowed for interesting possibilities and made the reunion of everyone at the end all the more gratifying.  This second viewing also allowed me to notice the effort put into connecting their separate journeys, which was actually done in a very nice and neat way that I can't discuss since, you know, spoilers.  There is also an overarching theme of family that radiates from the entire movie, and done in a very effective way.

The visuals in this movie are amazing and indicative of the advancement in technology we have achieved.  The CGI in this movie is really great, save for a few moments.  But for the most part it's truly astounding and even when it's iffy it is completely forgivable given the settings of the movie.  Even in this insane space chaos movie they melded practical effects into it nicely.  The makeup is great to look at on characters such as Drax and Nebula, and a lot of the times when people are flying around with jet packs it is evident that it was done with wires rather than CGI 100% of the time, so I appreciate that aspect.

This is overall a good, fun superhero movie.  It doesn't live up to the first movie, and the comedy is a little lacking and can make you roll your eyes occasionally, but the story is well thought out with good acting and voice acting and some pretty epic action sequences (the Yondu prison break sequence... if you've seen it then you know what I mean).  If you can bring yourself to look past its shortcomings, you will have a good time.  It is just annoying when you know they can do so much better.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-07

</i>
Powerful and simple.  I wouldn't call this a horror movie, in the same way I wouldn't call <i>Get Out</i> a horror movie.  This is definitely a psychological thriller.  The suspense is drawn out very well and the movie is very well paced overall, with the events naturally unfolding and no audience hand holding whatsoever.  It's as if we are passive observers of a few days in the lives of these people in this situation, and it works very well.  The acting isn't anything groundbreaking but it all works very well for the movie.  The story and the building tension work extremely well with the low budget.  I did find it a bit slow at the beginning and kind of hard to immerse myself into, but by the time the final shot was onscreen I realized that this was a very good movie.  I think now looking back on it that I didn't like it at first because it is just so different; even though the characters' situation feels like an overused one, it is approached very differently here.  The cinematography is perhaps the stand out of this movie, with the sound right below it, as the shots are beautiful and mysterious as they are clearly focused on a particular thing throughout the movie.  It's hard to say a lot about this movie because I think it's best to see this knowing as little as possible; even if you've seen the trailers, it doesn't matter, as they show pretty much nothing.  If you for some reason cannot stand a slower paced movie, then this isn't for you.  And if you're expecting a balls to the wall extreme horror flick, this isn't for you either.


The ambiguous nature of this movie will most definitely incite a wide variety of responses from audiences.  Personally, I liked it a lot.  The movie provided you with only what was absolutely necessary and allows you to figure out the rest.  It brings up many questions and provides answers to basically none of them.  Movies that have the confidence to do something like that almost always capture my affection, and it's no different here.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-08

Trash.  I didn't have high expectations coming into this movie.  I knew what I was getting myself into.  I predicted that 2 stars was the highest I'd possibly rate it, and I wasn't wrong.  This movie really didn't know what it wanted to be, with a serious tone setting up the ancient evil being contrasted regularly with campy humor and quips that feel like they were ripped from the worst Marvel movies.  Tom Cruise's character radiates pure douchebaggery, which is more the fault of the writers than him.  Even so, I must say that he nails a prick.  Russel Crowe's character felt a little forced and random, as I know it's just to set up this whole Dark Universe, but his acting wasn't terrible.  Some of the action wasn't too bad, such as the plane crash in which Tom Cruise and his female co star tumble around the interior completely with practical effects (no wires either).  But for the most part, everything was terrible, with terrible writing and structure that was just laughable.  The only reason I went was in the hopes of getting a good laugh, but I found myself just sitting there in quiet disappointment more often than I did laughing.  Not really worth watching unless you're a die hard Cruise fan.  If this is any indication of where the Dark Universe is headed, it's gonna suck.

Note: The only reason this isn't 1 star is because I have <i>King Arthur </i>there, and it just feels dirty to put this on the same level as that pile of horse crap.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-08

<i>Shimmer Lake</i> is a fairly solid crime drama, but it isn't amazing or truly unique in any way.  The story is told in reverse, starting on a Saturday.  Each chapter is on a different day moving backwards from Saturday, and they each begin with the same shot of different men and they each end with the same act, but with different people involved.  This style of storytelling certainly isn't anything new and the movie doesn't do anything with it to stand out as unique, but it still works for the story and makes it more interesting.  Pieces slowly fall into place until everything is tied together at the very end of the movie (which is coincidentally the very beginning of the depicted events).  The acting is all very adequate but nothing great.  This is described as a dark comedy, and while I wouldn't call it hysterical there are quite a few chuckle-worthy moments and even a couple of laugh out loud moments.  The reverse storytelling lended to the film both by creating dramatic irony and creating dark humor that would not be there had it been told chronologically.  If you like crime thrillers then give this a watch.  The plot is somewhat predictable and everything is just good enough to work, so it's not really anything more than a decent movie that does a good job of building suspense and keeping you guessing.","home, streaming",2017-06-09

Strange and beautiful.  I often forgot I was watching a stop-motion movie because of how naturally everything worked into the story; the brilliant story which really feels perfect for stop-motion as opposed to live action or other forms of animation. At first glance, this is an intriguing and clearly deep drama that does everything that a good movie should do perfectly, drawing you in. After watching, however, if one takes a step back to truly analyze the inner mechanisms of this film, that's where the incredible artistry of the movie shines. And I think that is the characteristic that elevates this movie to the status of a modern masterpiece, a truly calculated piece of art with incredibly relevant commentary. This is perhaps the best stop-motion film ever created, and if not it most certainly deserves to be somewhere in the top animated films of all time. A must-see.","home, streaming",2017-06-12

<i>Krisha</i> is most definitely one of the best directorial debut films ever.  In Trey Edward Shults's first film, he uses the low budget and production to his advantage with a fairly conventional plot executed in a brilliant way.  The camerawork and score are amazing, creating an extremely tense and sinister atmosphere in what should otherwise be a friendly environment (which effectively allows us to feel what the titular character is feeling).  The pacing is slow but works so well for the film, in the same way as Shults's recent film <i>It Comes At Night.</i>  Perhaps the most amazing part of this movie is that the majority of its characters are played by relatives and friends of the director.  They replicate the feeling of a family reunion so well.  The first half of the movie was the most incredibly accurate representation of family dysfunction I have ever seen in film (at least based on my own personal experience) and the rest of the movie has the intensity of a full-on thriller, which is so impressive given the subject matter.

In short, this is an extremely impressive independent drama film with brilliant direction, writing, editing, camerawork, and acting.  The kind of movie that will make you feel like you're holding your breath the entire time.","other, streaming",2017-06-16

I love these confined, character-led dramas that A24 does a lot of.  In the case of <i>Ex Machina</i> it's the same, but the film also tackles large philosophical and moral gray areas/questions through the situation of the three major characters.  In fact, you could liken this approach to existential questions through sci-fi to that of <i>Prometheus</i>, except that <i>Ex Machina</i>'s overall execution is MUCH more refined, engaging, and coherent.  I think this particular aspect is what can elevate a science fiction film from a simply good movie to a masterpiece.  Science fiction is just the perfect way to answer these questions that we as humans are naturally inclined to ponder.

Breaking down this movie into the essential parts still shows the masterful craftsmanship across the board.  The acting is amazing.  I had previously only seen Oscar Isaac in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, so it's wonderful to see his amazing range and skill on display here.  I had seen Domhnall Gleeson in an episode of <i>Black Mirror</i> where, ironically, HE is the artificial intelligence.  Lastly, I had only seen Alicia Vikander in the most recent Bourne movie, <i>Jason Bourne</i>, where her 'meh' performance reflected the overall 'meh'-ness of the movie itself.  So, it's nice to see her perform amazingly in a great role.

The colors are great, visual effects are better than most movies (even with the low budget), and the editing is great, especially with the separation of the story into chapters ('sessions').  The story is brilliantly simple (like other A24 movies and many other masterpieces of film), moves at a perfect pace, and doesn't include anything extraneous or unnecessary.  The score creates such an intense atmosphere, similar to <i>Krisha</i>.  Scenes that are already inherently intense become so much more so with the hair raising techno bass that gets louder and louder.  Once again, a movie that will make you hold your breath in suspense when it's not delighting you with the intriguing premise and characters.","other, streaming",2017-06-17

So simple, and yet so profound.  I'd like for the majority of modern filmmakers to look upon the structure of this film and perhaps realize that complicated doesn't always mean better.  This movie tells so much with so little, with true acting skill being showcased by Gosling through mostly facial expressions and body language.  The viewer can easily know what his character is thinking just by observing his posture and face.  Not only is the acting from Gosling and the rest of the cast remarkable, but the camerawork and lighting is unbelievably masterful.  This movie has one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen in a movie, taking a commonly used scenario and showing it from a completely different perspective than what we are used to.  The opening credits are also just so beautiful, and the accompanying music really makes you realize that you're in for a really good movie.  The entire soundtrack of this movie is incredibly unique and awesome, by the way.

As Refn usually does, he implements extremely graphic violence into certain parts of the film which some say take away from the movie.  Myself and many others I have heard from don't agree with that, however.  I believe the contrary, that Refn has accomplished the somewhat rare feat of successfully incorporating graphic violence into a story so that its use is completely justified and sensible.

This film has a simple yet intriguing plot, wonderful character development, and great writing.  This is the embodiment of ""show, don't tell"", as is <i>Only God Forgives</i>.  This is most definitely a gem of modern film that will be cherished and studied by film students for many years to come.  One could discuss this movie for hours.","home, streaming",2017-06-21

<i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i> is an amazing accomplishment of film.  It saddens me to know that it was a box office flop, but I can also see how this is a very person-specific kind of movie.  One must either really love it or really hate it, with not much in between.  The first thing I want to say is that regardless of your opinion on the plot and characters of the film, you cannot deny the absolutely masterful editing and direction in this movie.  Originality oozes out of every scene as video game and comic culture is blended seamlessly into this otherwise generic world, and the quick, snappy editing is done so perfectly that it makes this one of the most consistently engaging movies I've ever watched.  It never slows down, and at the same time never feels like it's going to fast.  The over the top action sequences are surprisingly well-shot for what they are and just plain freaking awesome.  This movie is the physical manifestation of the modern-day adolescent boy's imagination.  Did I mention it's hilarious?  I can't think of a joke that didn't land because when I try, my mind just goes to all of the ones that hit and hit hard.  So well-written and acted by the cast. This movie goes from 0 to 100 so abruptly and, being truely drawn in, I didn't stop to question it.  I just marveled in the epic Kung fu like beatdown that brought out my inner child.

This movie is <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> combined with any amazing kung-fu or superhero movie, but just way better.  Definitely a movie for the younger generation (30 or younger at least), because an older adult would most likely not understand and be annoyed by the constant arcade and video game gags running throughout the movie.  And, even being the insanity that this movie is, it <i>still</i> manages to pack a pretty strong message in there that isn't anything new but is done in just an awesome way.  Things that appear early on in the film pop up again in the final act to actually serve the ending in a way, which is both a great technique to use a film and pleasantly unexpected in this context.

This is seriously just the kind of movie that one could only describe using the words 'epic', 'awesome', and 'freakin cool'.  I found myself constantly saying or thinking to myself '...whoa' and hopefully, you will/did too.","home, streaming",2017-06-24

</i>
<i>Baby Driver</i> is such an amazing experience.  Edgar Wright is too good for this world.  His editing shines once again, with a special emphasis on sound this time around.  He has crafted this entire world as a living, breathing soundtrack, and it's incredible.  Everything from gunfire to faint car honks go in sync with the score playing in Baby's (Ansel Elgort) earbuds.  Any time his ear buds are out, a faint ringing fades in and out of the scene, replicating his ""hum in the drum.""  The combination of Elgort's impressive acting (he's gonna get some good roles after this) and the sound editing make the viewer feel more in tune with the protagonist and his emotions than any other movie I've seen.  Seriously, this needs to at least get the nomination for Best Sound Editing, or some members of the Academy are going to... go missing.

The star studded cast is not just for the big names.  Every role is casted and acted wonderfully, I love it.  Kevin Spacey is once again freaking amazing.  He's not even trying anymore, because he doesn't need to.  He doesn't even need to pretend like he's trying, because he and the viewers know that he's got this.  Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm are also great here.

As with all of Wright's work, this is funny.  I did notice that the humor felt more toned down and natural than the rest of his films, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Rather, it seems like a result of his taking on this action car genre, so he modified his style slightly to work better.  Wright's style still permeates from every scene of this movie, from the aforementioned editing to the gags that pop up throughout the movie, as Wright loves to do.  A specific scene with a TV was extremely reminiscent of a similar scene in <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>.

The opening sequence in this movie is great.  It's no <i>Drive,</i> but it accomplishes the feat of taking a conventional scene and putting a unique twist on it.  Wright's way of shooting the action was original and different, but at times felt a little shaky and cut a little too fast.  I think what keeps this from perfection is the overall style over substance mentality that the movie seems to have.  I absolutely love it and it works well, but at certain points it works at the expense of the writing, which is a little disappointing.  Overall it isn't a huge problem, it just felt slightly lacking in those areas.  This movie started off very strong and held onto it, but started to falter a little in the third act (despite some very exciting moments sprinkled here and there).

This is a very rewatchable movie.  I plan to see it two more times before it leaves theaters, because it is such an engaging, thrilling, unpredictable, and suspenseful action film.  Which is exactly what it was trying to be and should be.  Thank you for another glorious movie, Edgar, a beautiful escape from the sea of mindless action movies in theaters today.","theatre, cobb",2017-06-27
2017-07-07,Spider-Man: Homecoming,2017,https://boxd.it/ilPcB,3,,"<i>""Come on, Spider-Man... COME ON, Spider-Man!!""</i>

<i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i> is a fun addition to the MCU.  I went in not expecting to be either blown away or disappointed, and that's pretty much what happened.  I had a lot of fun with this movie but it still suffered a lot of the classic Marvel flaws.  Tom Holland is a great Peter and Spider-Man, and this honestly is my favorite film version of the character.  The writing and Holland's acting have nearly perfectly captured the young and innocent nature that makes Spider-Man who he is.  Michael Keaton as the Vulture got better as the movie went on, and the villain has a surprising amount of depth.  Still not anything amazing or a Joker from <i>The Dark Knight</i>, but relative to the rest of Marvel's villains he is easily one of the best.

Peter's high-tech suit from Civil War makes for a lot of entertaining and exciting moments as he tries to discover its full capabilities.  The action is probably the most forgettable part of this movie.  It's not terrible, but there's nothing really memorable either.  Pretty run-of-the-mill action sequences that just feel pretty meh even while you're watching it.  What this movie really succeeds at is just capturing the entire character of Peter/Spider-Man.  I love how integral the high school subplots ended up being to the main villain plot.

Iron Man is in this a lot less than he trailers make it seem, and Robert Downey Jr. is just as fun to watch as Tony as he always is.  Happy Hogan pops up quite a few times but he has some funny moments.  Peter's friend Ned and Aunt May are pretty much only there for the jokes, and their jokes aren't really funny most of the time.  All of the funniest moments I can remember came from unimportant characters as a result of strange and hilarious circumstances.  One of the funniest sequences is also the most tense part of the movie and my favorite part, which kicks off the third act and has you on the edge of your seat for a good 10 minutes straight.

The CGI was pretty good across the board, which I'm glad for because the trailers had me worried.  There were a couple of bad moments of just poor green screen and stuff like that, but other than that it was pretty good and they utilized a good amount of practical effects.

As I said before the villain had a surprising  amount of depth.  It was easy to understand where he was coming from and sympathize with him, and his villainous motives actually made logical sense and he had reasons for it (not that he's justified).  They even used his character to make some pretty relevant commentary on the upper class's attitude toward the blue collar workforce, which is pretty interesting and not what I'd expect from a Marvel movie.

Overall this is a great addition to the MCU and a HUGE improvement over the <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> duology.  I'd even go as far as to say this movie gets close to the quality of the first two Raimi films.  What this movie lacks in emotion it makes up for in it's absolutely stellar depiction of the main character.  And, for once, this feels like a self-contained movie about one hero instead of setting up the rest of he universe, which is very refreshing.  Tony may be waltzing in and out and dropping Avengers references but they don't feel like they're setting up anything, but instead just acknowledging we are in the same universe as those movies, which I really like.  Definitely go see this if you like Marvel or Spider-Man, and I will definitely give this a rewatch before it leaves theaters.  Now time to get hyped for <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>.","theatre, cobb",2017-07-06

One of the most intense theater experiences I've ever had. Nolan has once again masterfully crafted an amazing film, this time centered on a particularly miraculous event in World War II.

The acting across the board here is nothing short of incredible. Everyone is convincing in their roles. Foolish people may argue that it doesn't take much to do what they did because of the little amount of dialogue, but the emotions expressed through their faces and actions in their performances did so much more than one could consciously notice. It just adds to the immersion. I absolutely love that very few characters are called by name in the movie, because in reality the main character of the film is the event of Dunkirk itself, and we are simply experiencing it through the perspectives of different men that were present.

The historical accuracy of the movie is also incredible. I'm not much of a history buff myself, but based on little facts about the filming (such as Nolan filming with boats used in the actual Dunkirk evacuation) as well as the high praise for the film from a veteran who survived Dunkirk, I can say that this is one of the more accurate war films produced. Some people have disagreed with Nolan's depiction of the British soldiers, especially with their every man for himself mentality, but I think it just adds to the stakes and intensity that these men are experiencing.

My second viewing made me realize how perfectly this movie flows. We start with a couple minutes or so of calm, with a short prologue onscreen to explain the circumstances. As soon as the first shot is fired not long after, the film does not let up until the very end. The direction, acting, and score all come together to create an extremely suspenseful, on the edge of your seat experience. Every time there seems to be a moment of tranquility, something horrible happens. It's a tragic movie, but it does a terrific job of accurately depicting the horrors of war, even with the restrictions of a PG-13 rating. The choice by Nolan to tell the story from three different perspectives (land, sea, and air) is PURE genius. They act as self contained stories that occur over different lengths of time, from one week to one hour. They are separate for the most part but all cross over in the climax of the film, when the evacuation arrives. I've described this as the Pulp Fiction of war movies, which is a bit of a weird comparison, but is how I think of it due to the unconventional Out-of-order storytelling.

As aforementioned, the score by Hans Zimmer is a major factor in the suspense permeating this entire film. The majority of the score involves stringed instruments slowly rising in pitch as the sound of a ticking stopwatch or clock rattles continuously in the background. This is a genius way of doing a score, and not Zimmer's first time either. Quite a few of his other scores for Nolan have featured a ticking clock sound at some point, but not throughout the entire score as in this film. The ticking only stops at the exact moment in the end of the film when the men have the mental realization that they're finally home, and can finally relax. Zimmer also utilizes a sound illusion with the score. I'm not quite sure how it works, but somehow the score seems to always be getting higher and higher in pitch when in reality in never changes, but rather fluctuates back and forth. Long story short, the score is a major part of what makes this film such an experience.

Nolan's cinematography is godlike. I was constantly in awe at how he managed to pull off these bold shots, especially in all of the dogfight scenes that just felt so real (because they were really filmed in the air!). There are quite a few haunting wide shots that will stick in my mind for quite some time. Nolan constantly sets the bar for what a film can achieve and then constantly exceeds that bar. He is indisputably one of the best directors of all time due to his vision and ability to immerse the viewer in a variety of genres.

This movie is utterly flooring and terrifying. I definitely think it lost some of that when I rewatched in a regular theater the second time, which is why I recommend everyone to see this in IMAX. Not only is the screen much larger because this movie is filmed in IMAX, but the scope and quality of the sound is so much better. When planes came down to drop bombs, the screeching of their engines is some of the scariest sounds I've ever heard, and left my ears ringing. This truly does a terrific job of making the audience feel what those men felt as much as a movie can.

There's plenty more I could say about this movie, but the review is long enough as it is. I think this is an instant classic and one of the greatest war movies ever made. I think it will be timeless because of the overarching theme of anti-war and the incredible technical prowess that Nolan brought to the military film genre. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2017 (so far), and I will be utterly shocked if it does not at least receive that Oscar nomination (sound mixing too). This is a movie that must be seen in theaters. A true cinematic experience that will leave you reeling.","theatre, cobb",2017-07-26

One of the best movies of 2017?  Yes.  Amazing performance from Jennifer Lawrence?  Yes, and everyone else too.  Insanely controversial subject material and execution by Aronofsky?  Hell yes.

This movie is a 2 hour long visual poem that begs to be analyzed and interpreted from a wide variety of viewpoints.  It's insane, disturbing, unforgiving, and provides a surprisingly relevant and accurate commentary on humanity (at least in my interpretation).

Go watch this movie and form your own opinion and interpretation.  The information above is more than enough, though I recommend that you should realize that the importance of this movie and its message relies entirely on what the characters and events represent rather than what you're actually seeing.  You will be confused, but trust me it'll pay off.","theatre, cobb",2017-09-14

In the words of Zachary Ceranic (ceranicz2), this movie is the most accurate representation of anxiety put to screen (at least from what I’ve seen).

This almost makes me resent Adam Sandler, because if he’s capable of such brilliance, why does he allow the vast majority of his work to be mindless stupidity?

The score and camerawork capture the anxiety of Barry and in unique and impressive ways.  The plot is incredibly simple and barebones, which I’ve come to find as I watch more and more films usually tends to be a strong point.  Despite its simplicity there is an extremely satisfying beginning, middle, and end, and nothing is predictable.  It’s a quirky film but it’s a brilliant one that hits you in the feels.

Seriously though this is so good at depicting anxiety.  A couple of the scenes from this movie stand out to me as some of the most uncomfortably overwhelming scenes I’ve ever seen, there’s such a sensory overload and chaos in the images and characters and score that it becomes hard to watch, but yet so intriguing as it offers a glimpse into humanity in a way that could only be done through film.","home, blu-ray",2017-10-18

This was the fifth time I’ve watched <i>La La Land,</i> and it was a time I’ll never forget. I had the awesome opportunity to go to a screening at the Mahaffey Theatre in St. Petersburg, FL, at which the movie was projected onto a perfectly sized screen above a full symphony orchestra which played everything from the large musical numbers to the ambient music in normal scenes.

This was the most incredible filmwatching experience I’ve ever had, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. The music was literally brought to life in a way that just can’t be replicated otherwise. That combined with the absolute visual feast that is <i>La La Land</i> was almost overwhelming for my unworthy senses. The cherry on top was the use of dynamic spotlights cast on the orchestra, changing tones to match those in the movie. It all melded together so perfectly into a sensory explosion; I couldn’t have been more impressed.

<i>“What if this is the best version?”</i>

<i>Lady Bird</i>.  It’s hilarious, it’s heart-wrenching, it’s uplifting, it’s unforgivingly honest, it’s life. This is how you do a coming-of-age drama. So many subplots occur with no true main plot streamlining them all other than the act of simply getting by through life, in exactly the same way that real life operates. I found many aspects of this movie incredibly relatable, and a large chunk of it is exclusive to young women so I can only imagine that adolescent and older women alike would love this movie even moreso than myself. The acting is impeccable across the board, the score is great, and it’s just an engaging, perfectly-lengthed glimpse into the life of a 17-year old girl growing up in Sacramento and dealing with her personal struggles with Catholicism, family, and all the other struggles that come with the transition to adulthood. With the main character of Lady Bird also comes the perspectives and respective struggles of all those around her, which makes this one of those movies that is just a really fascinating and honest look at humanity as a whole. I love this movie and it may very well be the best movie of the year.

Furthermore, I feel like a lot of people are going to overlook how truly unique this movie is.  The focus on the mother-daughter relationship in this film is not like anything I’ve seen before; perhaps it is similar to other films in ways, but for the most part it is different enough to be very refreshing.  The handling of religion is also refreshing in that it’s not posed as an extreme negative as most movies would portray a Catholic school, but rather just another part of life that Lady Bird has to deal with.  In that way it allows the viewer to truly immerse his or herself into the characters and their lives, a rare feat that is only accomplished by the best of films.  Very rarely do I wish the movie would keep going when the credits roll, and that happened to me here.","theatre, cobb",2017-11-23

I liked this movie a lot. The cinematography was incredible and the bright colors were beautiful, stellar acting from the child actors and adult actors alike, and a great story.  Growing up in Florida, I feel that this movie did a great job of capturing the essence of Florida even though it was in areas that I’m mostly unfamiliar with. It was so awesome to see Orange World and Twistee Treat and to hear Polk County get name-dropped in a movie (an A24 movie, no less!!)

I have a huge problem with the ending. I really don’t like it, the major tonal shift just makes no sense and I don’t care what people try to say about it being ambiguous or a dream sequence or blah blah, it was just silly and stupid. I was so invested in the characters and there was such a tense and emotional build up at the end, and then suddenly I’m just hit with this random and nonsensical ending.  Major flaw in my opinion.  The rest of the movie is so well-shot and written and acted that I can’t let the last couple of minutes have <i>too</i> much of an impact on the overall rating, so I think4 Stars is generous.

It’s pretty awesome that I got to be a part of a Q&A with the producer after the showing at Polk Theatre, and the little actor for Scooty showed up too!  I didn’t get to ask any questions of my own, which is upsetting, but I’m still glad I got to be there for that and hear some inside info on the making of the film.  I should have run up to Kevin Chinoy (producer) and kneeled at his feet while asking him to get me a job at A24.","theatre, polk",2017-12-05

You were right, Luke.  It didn’t.

I’m just gonna be straight up, I thought this movie was just pretty alright. Maybe my expectations were too high (they were astronomically high) but I just wasn’t a huge fan of this movie. Sure, there were quite a few curveballs so I was kept on my toes about what was gonna happen next, but that doesn’t automatically create a great movie. For every incredible moment, there were three times as many boring or stupid moments. I applaud the filmmakers for trying to be different, this movie was definitely bold to go in the direction it did with such beloved characters and properties that usually have a pretty strict set of rules surrounding them.

3 stars is so much lower than I expected to give this movie but I don’t think I can go any higher at the moment.  After reflecting on the movie I’ve realized there’s some pretty nice themes and parallels running throughout that somewhat save it from the failings, so that helps a little but not much. There’s quite a few epic moments as well and I think the fight scenes were pretty great across the board, but the supposed clever humor that everyone won’t shut up about was nowhere to be found. For the most part, the humor didn’t land for me, and felt like it detracted from what was going on.

It’s hard to really say anything else without spoiling because so much of this movie is kept under wraps (which I greatly appreciate). All in all I had a fun time watching it, it did some things I love and some things I didn’t so much, but it could have been much worse.

An interesting concept, sure, executed in a terrible way. On numerous occasions the movie was just trying way too hard to be sentimental or something and that ended with it coming across as very cheap and stupid (and not in a self-aware manner, as the director seems to want you to think). People say that this is a shameless attempt at capturing Wes Andersen’s style, and I definitely see it. Roman Coppola doesn’t understand what makes Andersen great, instead opting to be wacky because... well, I don’t know, just for the sake of being wacky?  

A couple of scenes were genuinely decent, and Charlie Sheen was surprisingly bearable in the lead role, most likely because he’s basically playing a caricature of himself. Furthermore, Jason Schwartzmann did the best with what he was given and I can respect that. Bill Murray gave me a couple chuckles even though it was pretty obvious he was just there for the check.

Even after Alien arrives the movie doesn’t amount to anything huge, but the beautiful visuals and cinematography make up for the fairly superficial story. The piano montage is the standout of this film, employing the tried-and-true “let’s play music over a violent scene that doesn’t match what’s happening at all!!”, but for whatever reason it works here, and well.

This movie is definitely not what it seems, but the major flaw is that you have to get about 40 minutes into the movie before it starts to shine. And for most people, they’re already long gone by then, and I can’t blame them.","home, streaming",2017-12-27

This movie can best be described as a dog turd covered in many layers of colorful paint and sparkles that, for most viewers, will hide the fact that it is still indeed a dog turd.

I can acknowledge and admire the work that went into the elaborate musical numbers, with some pretty impressive choreography at times and explosions of color, but that doesn’t mean I liked them.  The stuff shoved in between the almost <i>too</i> elaborate musical numbers was boring and cliché drama sprinkled with some heavy-handed social commentary.  One line in particular near the end had me cringing, not only because of how forced the “progressive” idea felt, but how incredibly inaccurate it was for a character in this setting to be saying things that came straight out of a social justice warrior’s review for this movie.

The supposed-to-be-powerful “This is Me” number about self-empowerment is ruined if you simply think logically for one second, as the only reason anyone came to these shows of oddities was to marvel in shock and awe at these freaks of nature; stay true to yourself and you will be empowered, even though the only reason everyone is paying to be here is to point and laugh at you!

I really liked the opening sequence, and it may have been the best part of the movie for me.  It pretty much just went downhill and never went back up the whole time.  The entire experience is ruined if you reflect even for a moment on the true history and nature of P.T. Barnum, which causes you to realize that this is not how any of the true events happened.  This is some pretty run-of-the-mill fodder that I think most will enjoy but even the glassy-eyed moviegoer will see some of its flaws.","theatre, cobb",2018-01-01

This movie is kinda interesting in that it’s based on real events, but there’s not much else that appealed to me.  It was mostly a bore and it felt really repetitive with every break-in pretty much the same as the last.  The acting was always at least decent and the cinematography was good, but the writing felt stale a lot of times and even messy.  The subject material that Sofia Coppola based this off of was pretty barebones, which explains why it feels like it drags on even in the short 90 minute runtime.  I also wish the movie had explored implications more instead of just relying on the singular commentary of the lifestyle of modern hedonistic teens for the entire movie.","home, streaming",2018-01-03

What starts off as a predictable yet enjoyable teen romance flick shifts into something completely different in the second act.  This movie is not afraid to dive into some dark issues like family abandonment, alcoholism, and the lasting effects of these on children as they mature into adults.  The acting is great across the board but the two leads stand out the most.  Incredibly realistic dialogue and characters, great cinematography, great acting, and written in a way that it takes your expectations from a teen drama and subverts them.  What more can you ask for?  I have some issues with a certain climactic event that doesn’t seem to hold any real consequences when it <i>should</i>, as well as the strange pacing after the event.  Other than that, this is a fantastic movie about letting go of the past and living in the now (while still making sure to look ahead to your future).","home, streaming",2018-01-06

<i>“Chaos is order yet undeciphered.”</i>

I love this mind-bending psychological thriller, but it’s really hard to talk about any of it without giving things away.  Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible as always, and when his character discovers that he has a doppelgänger (also played by Gyllenhaal) he takes it upon himself to track this guy down.  This is a very metaphorical movie, so if you look at it from surface level only then it’s not going to make much sense.  It’s the kind of movie that makes you think by taking an original approach to storytelling, and it’s fantastic.  The acting, tight cinematography, score, and color grading of sandy yellow give the entire movie a very unique tone and a strong aura of suspense.  If you like a thriller mystery, then you’ll like this a lot; just don’t expect any straightforward answers by the end.  As the quote above states, the movie comes across as chaos at first, but order is there—you just need to find it.","home, blu-ray",2017-12-02

</i>
This is such a weird experience and one that was, at least for me, very polarizing.  I thought I didn’t like it when it was over, and then I thought maybe I really did like it and I was just frustrated at the unorthodox structure, but then I’d start to think it was pretentious... I’m still not really sure what I think about it.  I’d need to watch it again.  I started at 3 stars, then moved it down to 2.5, then 3.5, and finally up to 4.  What the heck is that about?  I never do that.

There’s some great themes here that are conveyed in a story medium that I don’t think anyone else would have thought of.  I love when movies show and don’t tell, but this movie is pretty much all show and no tell, which can get a bit annoying and is probably a deal-breaker for the common moviegoer.  It encourages you to try and experience film in a way different to that which you’re used to, because this is more about the visual and auditory experience to provide some commentary on humanity and beauty rather than the plot.  

This is super hard to talk about, especially since I still don’t really know how I really feel about it.  I’d say give it a shot and don’t just shut it off if you start getting frustrated—see it through to the end, and then think about what you just saw and what it means.  You’ll probably think it’s a bit pretentious (so do I) but to each his own, this is just how the artist chose to do it.  Very unique and interesting, and Scarlett Johansson is a legendary actress both for her performance and just for being daring enough to play a role like this.","home, blu-ray",2017-12-25

<i>“I want to know that I’m not driving in one direction.”</i>

On paper, this movie seems like a bad idea.  In fact, it sounds like the synopsis for a radio drama.  Without spoiling any of the plot, I can say that for the entirety of this movie’s 85-minute runtime, there is only one man on screen.  Not only this, but he’s driving the entire time.  The whole film is just Tom Hardy driving to London and making Bluetooth phone calls to various people, but it works very well.  I have to give major credit to not only the writing but Tom Hardy himself; he makes this concept work with his fantastic expressions and subtleties that give deep insights into his character.  The actors whose voices are heard over the phone are great as well, making everything that’s happening extremely convincing.  Needless to say, the movie does drag a bit at times, which I think is almost impossible to avoid given the concept, and one part of Ivan Locke’s character felt a bit cheesy and over dramatic to me, but it still fit.  I would recommend this movie to anyone because Tom Hardy is so brilliant, but if you are impatient and don’t like a slow-burn movie, then you should probably pass on this one.","home, streaming",2017-12-03

I really like how this movie handled a controversial topic.  Almost every movie that’s got some edgy subject material has to take a positive or negative stance on it, but this film does a fantastic job of staying neutral.  Rather than pro-this or anti-that, it presents characters in a situation and says, “This is a thing that happens.”  I can’t say enough about how refreshing this is.

That being said, I didn’t find too much else to love in this movie.  Everything else was pretty standard, and maybe it’s just me, but I found a good portion of the humor to just be more gross than funny.  I’ve never been a huge fan of Jenny Slate, and I found her character in this movie to be somewhat annoying—which, in this case, probably means that she’s doing a good job.  So yeah, mostly standard across the board with some unfunny potty humor and nothing truly dazzling except for its approach to the topic.  3 stars for being average overall with that extra little bump for the subject material.","home, streaming",2018-01-12

<i>“Not everything has to be about something.”</i>

This movie is so engaging, almost entirely due to its acting talent.  Guy Pearce as the mysterious and unstable lead character is incredibly intriguing.  We know what he wants but are confused by his seemingly illogical motives, and that alone is enough to keep one involved in this story until the very end.  He speaks somewhat rarely and when he does, it’s in short yet powerful phrases.  When he isn’t speaking, his physical expressions make it clear what he’s feeling or thinking.  Fantastic acting.  Robert Pattinson is also great in a role that I never would have seen him play, a dim witted Southern American.  He nails that Southern drawl and the small tics and mannerisms of a boy who wasn’t educated in his prime developmental years, all the while exuding an innocent and likeable personality.  All of the supporting actors perform incredibly as well.

The mystery of Pearce’s character is reflected in the mystery of the situation—the only information we receive is that an economic collapse occurred ten years prior, and every glimpse we see of Australia’s lawless wasteland is enough for the viewer to craft their own explanation.  There’s commentary on loyalty and vengeance (and when you’ve gone too far) coupled with an overall realistic exploration of how individuals would change in an apocalypse of sorts.  The climactic end scene and final moments of the film are definitely some of my favorites out of any movie in this post-apocalypse genre.  I can’t wait to watch it again with the newfound knowledge granted by the ending.","home, streaming",2018-01-14

<i>
</i>This movie had a lot of potential.  I’ve seen a lot of people criticizing the first half, saying that the movie takes a while to get going, but I thought the complete opposite.  I like how they chose to start the movie off and slowly ease into the concept of zombification (or resurrection, as Beth’s parents would like to believe).  The acting wasn’t amazing but it was good, and it was a pretty good depiction of grief.  The approach to zombies was interesting and made me want to watch and find out what caused it in this world.

A little less than halfway through, this starts getting stupid.  The occasional funny moment turns into gags that feel lazy and just outright dumb.  Character development makes no sense, the tone is all over the place, and this movie just doesn’t know what it wants to be.  Don’t get me wrong, contrasting tones can work very well (<i>Shaun of the Dead</i> comes to mind since it’s in the same genre), but it doesn’t work here.  The ending feels rushed, unsatisfying, and to be honest, it felt a bit condescending to me as a viewer at times.

Such an unusual, ambitious film that attempts the extremely difficult task of translating the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to film—and makes it work.  I don’t feel as though I have a complete grasp on it, yet I was intrigued and amazed by it.  It certainly seems confusing and blurs the line between dream and reality until they’re indistinguishable from one another; but, somehow, I never <i>felt</i> confused.  The fantastic writing, acting, and technical beauty kept me from being bothered by the insanely experimental plot.  This is a film that encourages philosophical discussion and multiple rewatches in order to decipher what you think it means.  All I can be completely sure about is that this movie is about choice, and the infinite possibilities that come with it.  Until a choice is made, all possibilities are equally likely (a la Schrödinger’s cat) and outcomes are determined by an indeterminably long sequence of seemingly meaningless events (Butterfly Effect).  I feel as though I have only scraped the surface here, and I hope to eventually peel back the many layers of this work of art.

Anton Yelchin gives what I believe is the last performance of his career here, and I can honestly say he was great.  It’s probably one of his better performances as he stole every one of the few scenes he was in.  It’s a shame that this young talent left us so soon as I would have loved to see more from him.","theatre, cobb",2018-03-11

I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: Stanley Kubrick is a god among men.  I am repeatedly amazed by his achievements with every one of his films I watch.  They stand the test of time beautifully and often cause me to reconsider the achievements of modern film, as his genius undermines a lot of what I thought to be grand achievements from other filmmakers.

I found this movie to be hilarious, but not in a laugh out loud kind of way (most of the time).  Peter Sellers is particularly outstanding in the three major roles he plays so uniquely—I often forgot that they were played by the same actor, as he truly transformed his performance to fit each role.  Luckily, my history course had just finished the Cold War unit before I watched this, so that helped a lot in my understanding of the events this movie is satirizing.  Despite this, I think the movie can still be thoroughly enjoyed by someone with limited knowledge on the Cold War as the over-the-top characters and events are universally comedic.

To be honest, I had put off watching this movie with fear that my limited historical knowledge would keep me from understanding and therefore enjoying it.  Clearly, I was wrong.  Everyone should watch <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> because it is an undeniable landmark in both filmmaking and American history, and just an overall entertaining and masterfully crafted movie.","home, blu-ray",2018-03-24

I like it.  It was a little too much at times, but overall it was clever and fit well with the movie’s concept (look at the title).

It did slow down quite a bit in the second act after an intense climactic sequence, and had some trouble deciding what kind of movie it wanted to be as it went on.  At times the genre blending worked really well, though.","theatre, polk",2018-07-17

J.J. Abrams brought a different directorial approach than 1 and 2 in his shooting and editing that supplemented the Mission: Impossible vibe so well.  For that reason, cheesy moments were a lot more enjoyable and forgivable than in the last two.

Also there were some genuinely funny moments that balanced out the tone well, mostly thanks to the treasure that is Simon Pegg.

What the third lacks in epic stunts it makes up for in what I think are the best plot line and villain in the series.  Ghost Protocol keeps the momentum with some truly stunning stunt work but disappoints in the plot department, with a pretty horrible villain.

Now Rogue Nation somehow ups the action and stunts even <i>more</i> from Ghost Protocol, consistently delivering multiple breathtaking action set pieces from the very opening scene (best opening in the series).  What puts this movie above Ghost Protocol for me is not only the sheer amount of awesome stunts, but also the villain and plot, which aren’t fantastic by any means but are certainly a step up from the predecessor.

I’m so glad to say that I found this movie to be quite solid, especially relative to the rest of the MCU.  But, at the same time, I don’t think we should settle for these movies with strong lead women surrounded by utter mediocrity.  I feel that <i>Wonder Woman</i> suffered similarly, although <i>Captain Marvel</i> is certainly a big step in the right direction.

Either way, just having a lead woman in your movie is not enough to make it a good movie.  I will admit that the underlying messages here were, for the most part, handled very well and came across in a way that lended to the story rather than being shoved in your face.  But Marvel (and certainly all of Hollywood) can definitely continue to improve in their portrayal of women.

The only reason I’m not upset about Carol Danvers feeling emotionally dry and cookie-cutter at times is because Marvel does that with almost everybody.  Even so, they can do better, and major props to Larson for really committing to the character and making her as compelling as she could with what she was given.

It’s absolutely wonderful that this movie exists, but if we can consider it a stepping stone towards compelling female leads in mainstream film rather than the exemplar, then we’re on the right track.","theatre, regal, celebration pointe 10, sinemia",2019-03-11

Overall I just found it to be passable, just a mediocre teen comedy with a few shining moments.  I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy myself or if I said it wasn’t well-made, but I just found it too cheesy and aimless for my own taste.

It’s dreadfully meaningless and self-indulgent, but at the same time it’s seriously hilarious and self-aware.  It’s clearly a parody, but it strolls into mind-numbingly dumb territory more than once.  It can be quite bizarre and frustrating despite the obvious intention of mockery.  I’ve never been so conflicted!

The only thing I can definitively say is that you need to really try and not take this at face value, however tempted you may be to do so.  My rating is very likely to shift, and I don’t even really know how to describe this movie, but I think this sentence from the plot synopsis sums it up pretty well:

I felt like I remembered everything about this movie wrong, and was shocked by bad acting, strange editing choices, and my overall lack of terror.  Now, I’m sure much of this can be attributed to the massive desensitization of my generation as well as our exposure to technically superior modern movies... but either way, it sadly just didn’t work for me as well as it does for others.  Undeniably revolutionary and certainly not a horrible movie, but not one of my favorites.","canada, streaming",2019-06-25

I could go into more detail on why this didn’t work too well for me, but I’d rather point out some things I really liked about the movie.  The animation is, unsurprisingly, some of the best I’ve ever seen—truly mind-boggling and such a pleasure for the eyes.  The new characters are quite charming for the most part, and don’t overstay their welcome.  Previous comments notwithstanding, there are some genuinely heartfelt moments that really nailed it on an emotional level, but only here and there.

Overall, I guess I’m just really bummed out that I didn’t like this as much as everyone else did (especially as a follow-up to a fantastic trilogy).  Maybe I’m being too harsh, but this movie just felt like it lacked the heart of the first three, save for a few moments.

Second, the MPAA has clearly loosened up a SHIT ton on what is allowed in an R rated film, at least in regard to sexual content.  Either that, or the filmmakers pulled that priming thing where they send in the movie with excessively graphic footage that they always intended to remove just to secure an R rating.

The driver points out a car that followed them to the house, asking the Dude who his “friend in the Volkswagen” is.  This is the first time the audience sees this car, and before he can respond, the Dude gets dragged to the other side of the street and thrown into Mr. Lebowski’s limo by <i>his </i>driver.

I’ve always been so fascinated by this small moment.  In just fifteen seconds, we see the Dude confronted by three separate parties who all need him in some way to get out of this mess... a mess that the Dude only stumbled into because he just so happened to have the last name Lebowski.

I feel like no other moment in the movie illustrates the genius of its meticulously crafted chaos and absurdity as well as those fifteen seconds.  As if all that wasn’t incredible enough, what is the Dude’s only protest as he is ruthlessly shoved between these groups who don’t give a single shit about him, dragged from one limousine to the other?

2020-08-13,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,1992,https://boxd.it/1iyHL3,5,Yes,"Where does BOB end and where does Leland Palmer begin?  This is one of the many big questions that <i>Fire Walk With Me</i> asks, a question that the original series didn’t really care to ponder, or at best considered it an afterthought.

This film is not nearly as eager to free Leland from blame as the original series was; in fact, I think it puts the blame entirely back on him.  Who is BOB?  Albert Rosenfield pondered it himself in the original series: “Maybe that’s just what BOB is... the evil that men do.”  That idea, which was really nothing more than a suggestion of an alternate way to interpret the show, is presented so explicitly here that I find it hard to see BOB as anything other than exactly that—a symbol for the evil of men.  Is Leland really a victim here?  The farthest I would go is to call him a victim to his own dark thoughts and desires, which he ultimately succumbs to as he periodically rapes and eventually murders his own daughter.  In that sense, he is a victim of BOB, yet BOB is still part of him.

In the film, as Leland/BOB returns to the Black Lodge after killing Laura, we see a quick overlaid shot of a makeup-covered Leland screaming out in agony (black lipstick and powdered face).  Leland is a very complex character and is undoubtedly in an endless internal conflict.  That shot of him crying out represents this conflict, as whatever goodness left in him is tormented by his evil deeds... that is the man who loves his daughter, the man who resents himself for how much suffering he has brought to her.  The man who is a “victim” of BOB.

After verbally abusing Laura at the dinner table (“These hands are filthy!”), Leland sits in his bedroom with a twisted scowl on his face.  This scowl gradually fades as Leland’s face shifts to a neutral expression, before twisting yet again—but now, it’s an expression of horrible sadness.  He sobs.  Was this BOB literally leaving Leland’s body, and Leland being suddenly overcome with sadness and remorse over something he doesn’t even remember doing?  Or is it the typical behavior of an abuser, lashing out and hurting their victim before becoming immediately apologetic, telling the victim how much they love and care about them (which is exactly what Leland does next)?  That’s the beauty of the film and really all of Lynch’s work—it’s both.

Is Leland a victim in all this, haunted and possessed by a psychotic entity driven by violence and evil desires?  Or is BOB nothing but a projection of his own tormented psyche as he struggles to fight his dark and twisted urges?  Or, better yet, is BOB a projection from Laura’s mind, as the only way for a young girl to rationalize her own father doing these unspeakable things to her?  Well, the answer is simple... it’s whatever you think it is.

I know I probably haven’t said anything new here, but I wanted to write it all down anyway.  Also, Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise give two of the best performances I’ve ever seen in a film.  Both of them absolutely dominate their scenes and when they share a scene together (pretty often), it is an absolute treat... their dynamic as actors and as characters is just unmatched.

I haven’t even gotten into HALF of the things that I think make this movie so perfect... the harrowing and sympathetic depiction of Laura’s experience as a victim of incestuous rape and her ways of coping/fighting back/reclaiming herself, the reluctance of those around her to believe her story just like real life victims of rape and abuse (Harold’s “Bob is not real”)... but we’re not gonna talk about that.  In fact, we’re not gonna talk about it at all.  I’ll save all that for another time!","home, blu-ray",2020-08-11

it’s unbelievable how much Lynch and his crew were able to accomplish artistically in a prequel film to a beloved TV series.  it’s honestly unfair, it should not be this good.

a campy surreal cop serial / soap opera ended up becoming a very serious and soul-crushing look at abuse, trauma, and how victims react to them.  it was all there in the show, vague and implied, but it’s shoved in your face here with no more sugar-coating.  and yet, it still manages to exude some of that Lynch optimism through Laura’s unrelenting resistance (even to her death) against the darkness which threatens to consume her.

it is horrific to watch but by the end, I’m always left with a feeling of hope, the knowing that there will always be a goodness to fight back even in the face of unfathomable evil and darkness.  the light and the dark baby.  the balance.  the constant threat of darkness which the light always persists through.  that’s what Lynch is all about, and this is probably where he illustrates that idea best

2021-07-28,El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019,https://boxd.it/21CJgp,3,Yes,"just finished my rewatch of breaking bad, and it was nice to roll straight into this. works well as an epilogue but my feelings are the same as when I first watched it—enjoyable, but not really necessary.

now a quick review of breaking bad:

my first watch of breaking bad was when I was 15 years old. definitely too young for that shit. not just because of the mature content but also because of all the layers and nuances to all the relationships and motives, a lot of which was lost on my adolescent mind. truly one of the greatest works on television, and probably my favorite show.

Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve all the credit they get for their all-timer performances, but the same goes for literally the entire cast and crew who were firing on all cylinders for five seasons straight. when I watched this as a 15-year-old I liked to say that absolutely everyone involved in the making of the show was in perfect sync throughout its entire run, and I’m glad that I still feel the same way (if not even stronger).

I watched Breaking Bad right before I seriously got into movies. Thank you Vince Gilligan and crew for getting me into ~cinema~","home, streaming",2021-07-24

Nowadays the “killer keeps suffering serious wounds and never dies” trope is so prevalent that it’s easy to watch this and roll your eyes every time Michael gets back up, but I think it works perfectly here. His resilience becomes more and more implausible, each time silently whispering to yourself “when is this guy gonna die??”, until finally he suffers injuries severe enough that survival would actually be impossible… only for Dr. Loomis to look off the balcony and find that, after 15 years with this patient, all his premonitions are suddenly and unquestionably proven true.
