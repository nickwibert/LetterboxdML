2016-12-12,https://boxd.it/cpKy7,"I loved Tamatoa. He had an awesome song that was happy-sounding yet terrifying when you consider the fact that he's beating up a helpless Maui while singing.  Disney was smart to give him only around 10 minutes in the movie so as to not overstay his welcome, it makes the villain more memorable."

2017-04-11,https://boxd.it/gj27l,"Definitely go for a second viewing, it's great to pick out all the little bread crumbs about the true nature of the family that Peele sprinkles throughout the first and second acts.  Although, having the wild reactions of a full theater certainly made the first viewing more enjoyable!"

2017-06-03,https://boxd.it/hAU4D,So many comparisons have been drawn to Marvel by you that I don't think they apply only to Marvel anymore
2017-06-03,https://boxd.it/hASUd,"@zombifan  Agreed.  People can dish out hate on Marvel all they want but you cannot deny how successful their formula has been.  Introducing characters through standalone films and THEN having them come together works much better, and was clearly planned out far in advance"

I despise what you bring out in me.
Your concerns are petty.


You are a stumbling block."
2018-12-09,https://boxd.it/zLCfH,"@RadBradH to be honest with you I had this at a tentative 4.5 initially, but I changed it to 4 because I’d rather leave room for growth than bump it down later (I plan to rewatch very soon).

That being said, the movie does lose some of its momentum in the last 20 minutes or so with some clichés and cheesiness that really stick out to me considering how original and genre-bending the rest of the movie was.  Also, an interesting Morales family dynamic is set up but barely explored which was a bit disappointing.  But these are still minor gripes with an excellent character-driven Spider-Man flick."
2018-12-09,https://boxd.it/zLCfH,"...adding onto that, I’m generally a very picky rater.  I start a movie off at 2.5 stars (average) and then bump it up or down based on how I felt about it.  5-stars is reserved for a small selection of movies that truly shook me to my core and had a big impact on me in some regard."
2018-12-15,https://boxd.it/A3OTv,@calvinkemph Yes!
2018-12-16,https://boxd.it/A3OTv,"@Jotard well, sorry to offend, but the white savior narrative doesn’t really have a religious connotation. Simply about a group of non-white people who, being unable to save themselves, are saved from their plight by a white hero who swoops in.

There is some religious imagery as well, though, as Eastwood’s character is clearly depicted as a Christ figure with the blatant crucifix-pose he makes near the end. If it wasn’t intentional then it was certainly a subconscious decision to make him like a messiah for the minority."
2018-12-16,https://boxd.it/A3OTv,"Also I know that the movie isn’t painting racism as good, obviously their intention was to say racism is wrong. But the way that they wrote the narrative and presented the racism makes it almost seem like the movie is supporting—or perhaps even rewarding—Kowalski’s racism."
2018-12-17,https://boxd.it/A6L0D,"@The_Fox 
Agreed."
2018-12-17,https://boxd.it/zLCfH,"@altmack

2018-12-22,https://boxd.it/An3gh,"@TheFilmSlacker well, my mother is the type of viewer to ask a lot of questions and/or shout her thoughts at any given moment instead of waiting to see where the movie is going with a scene. And my father just cracks jokes left and right regardless of the movie, which really kills the mood for this one (especially in those final 15 minutes)"
2019-01-01,https://boxd.it/AWRRR,"@hgcaldwell00 I agree, but the Academy is pretty crazy. There’s probably like three movies that I’d be okay with winning Best Picture—<i>Roma</i> included—but it’s probably going to end up being something else entirely."

The part I’m talking about is when he is assigned by his workplace to travel by ferry, and he is clearly reluctant to do it but goes anyway, and as he slowly walks on the pier you see a deliberately placed rowboat that is like half underwater

I love it so much because it works as an introduction to his fear like any other movie would, but has that added layer of this being a giant movie set so you know his assignment and that sinking boat were all planned out to make for a dramatic moment by taking advantage of his trauma"
