Perhaps it was because of my low expectations for this movie, but I actually enjoyed it.  It had the cheesiness and dirty humor that you would expect from a buddy cop movie starring Kevin Hart, but I was surprised at the unpredictability and cleverness the plot contained that was hidden from the trailers.  The action scenes weren't above average but they worked, and some cameos from famous actors along with quite a few pop culture references made me laugh more than I thought I would.  Certainly not one of the best movies of the year, but it's one worth watching albeit by renting or going to a cheap theater.",,2016-06-18
2016-08-05,Suicide Squad,2016,https://boxd.it/aJEbj,2,,"<i>""It's on, bitch.""</i>

<i>Suicide Squad</i> was so much fun and a very entertaining film... for a comic fan.  I'm not saying you have to be a hardcore comic junkie to enjoy it, but chances are if the only experience you've had with superheroes are the movies then you're going be a little confused when it comes to the plot and back stories.  Regardless, there's fun action and banter back and forth between the squad members, but if you don't know the origin of the Joker then you won't have a clue what's going on in Harley's flashbacks.

I enjoyed this as a comic film fan but I could see its flaws.  Only a couple of the squad members were fleshed out well while the rest had a vague back story or none at all.  Some felt like they didn't belong, especially Katana.  She was useful to the squad but she had no reason to be there.  The squad members are supposed to be malicious but they're portrayed in an extremely likeable manner.  I think it would have paid off better if they had made appearances in previous films so that we were well aware that they are baddies, because in the film most of them (especially Deadshot) come off as truly good guys.

Another problem I had was with the movie's basic plot, specifically the villain.  The problem they set out to stop was caused by the assemblance of the squad.  So basically none of the catastrophic events would have occurred if everybody had stayed home or in jail, and I find this pretty annoying.

Everyone is talking about the soundtrack and how great it is but I thought it was very hit-or-miss.  They went a little overboard with the pop culture songs but they worked sometimes, like ""You Don't Own Me"" in Harley's introduction and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" in the closing.  Others did not work at all and were very off putting, like ""Seven Nation Army"" being used as the squad is assembling and going over the mission.  Maybe if they had just used the music and beat it might have worked but it didn't feel right hearing the singer at the same time as the characters spoke their lines, and the song itself just didn't fit the movie at all in my opinion.

Leto's Joker is original, and I like that, though at times his muttered tone sounded very VERY similar to Ledger's Joker.  I'm not a huge fan of this new gangster Joker look but I think it was a good performance and I wish we could have seen a little bit more of him (maybe in an Ultimate Edition?).

I walked out of the theater thinking it was a four star movie because I enjoyed it so much, but after thinking about it and breaking it down logically I realize it's more suited for a 3.5 or 3 star rating.  For the enjoyment factor, great action, and some good performances sprinkled on top of mediocre ones, it's a movie worth watching as long as you enjoy superhero movies.",,2016-08-04

It is a perfect celebration of all things Spider-Man; a beautiful love letter to the lifelong fans, but at the same time a spark to reinvigorate the franchise for newer or casual fans.

And the overarching message is just perfect, for old and young audiences alike. <i>Anyone</i> can wear the mask, regardless of whether you’re white, black, male, female... a pig?? ANYONE can be Spider-Man.
